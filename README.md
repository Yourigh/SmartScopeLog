# SmartScopeLog
LABVIEW based application to log voltages measured by SmartScope during a longer time periods that the official appllication makes convinient.

# Help needed
The source files for the SmartScope control are saved in LabVIEW version 2016, whereas I have only LabVIEW 2013 version. If you could save the files to previous version, it would help me to progress with this project.
